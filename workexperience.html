				<h2>2018 (December) - 2019 (February)</h2>
				<p>Worked at Servay Supermarket, Sipitang, as a Storekeeper for 2 months until I had to continue my studies on May. It was my first job ever and I've gained so much experience in the world of working.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>2021 (September) - 2021 (October)</h2>
				<p>After finished my STPM, I worked at 99 Speedmart, Mesapol, also as Storekeeper. It was quite challenging to worked with people that are older than you, hence that's why I only worked for over a month there.</p>

				<h2>2021 (December) - 2021 (February)</h2>
				<p>After leaving 99 Speedmart, I worked at Mr.DIY, as a cashier since I had some experience in that department. Until I got a call for my degree.</p>
